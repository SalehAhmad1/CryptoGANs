# CryptoGANs
CryptoGANs is a deep learning project that uses two different architectures for the generator and discriminator models to regenerate Cryptopunks art and perform a comparative analysis of them. This project was created as a final project for the course Digital Image Processing CS-4055.

# Project Overview
Cryptopunks is a collection of 10,000 unique 8-bit characters, each with their own distinct traits and characteristics. The goal of this project is to regenerate these Cryptopunks characters with GANs and create new and unique punk inspired art.
